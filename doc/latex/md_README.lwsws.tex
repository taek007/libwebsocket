\subsection*{Libwebsockets Web Server }

lwsws is an implementation of a very lightweight, ws-\/capable generic web server, which uses libwebsockets to implement everything underneath.

\subsection*{Build }

Just enable -\/\+D\+L\+W\+S\+\_\+\+W\+I\+T\+H\+\_\+\+L\+W\+S\+WS=1 at cmake-\/time.

It enables libuv and plugin support automatically.

\subsection*{Configuration }

lwsws uses J\+S\+ON config files, they\textquotesingle{}re pure J\+S\+ON but \# may be used to turn the rest of the line into a comment.

There is a single file intended for global settings

/etc/lwsws/conf 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 # these are the server global settings
2 # stuff related to vhosts should go in one
3 # file per vhost in ../conf.d/
4 
5 \{
6   "global": \{
7    "uid": "48",  # apache user
8    "gid": "48",  # apache user
9    "count-threads": "1",
10    "server-string": "myserver v1", # returned in http headers
11    "init-ssl": "yes"
12  \}
13 \}
\end{DoxyCode}
 and a config directory intended to take one file per vhost

/etc/lwsws/conf.d/warmcat.\+com 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 \{
2         "vhosts": [\{
3                 "name": "warmcat.com",
4                 "port": "443",
5                 "interface": "eth0",  # optional
6                 "host-ssl-key": "/etc/pki/tls/private/warmcat.com.key",  # if given enable ssl
7                 "host-ssl-cert": "/etc/pki/tls/certs/warmcat.com.crt",
8                 "host-ssl-ca": "/etc/pki/tls/certs/warmcat.com.cer",
9                 "mounts": [\{  # autoserve
10                         "mountpoint": "/",
11                         "origin": "file:///var/www/warmcat.com",
12                         "default": "index.html"
13                 \}]
14         \}]
15 \}
\end{DoxyCode}
 To get started quickly, an example config reproducing the old test server on port 7681, non-\/\+S\+SL is provided. To set it up 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 # mkdir -p /etc/lwsws/conf.d /var/log/lwsws
2 # cp ./lwsws/etc-lwsws-conf-EXAMPLE /etc/lwsws/conf
3 # cp ./lwsws/etc-lwsws-conf.d-localhost-EXAMPLE /etc/lwsws/conf.d/test-server
4 # sudo lwsws
\end{DoxyCode}
 \subsection*{Vhosts }

One server can run many vhosts, where S\+SL is in use S\+NI is used to match the connection to a vhost and its vhost-\/specific S\+SL keys during S\+SL negotiation.

Listing multiple vhosts looks something like this 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 \{
2  "vhosts": [ \{
3      "name": "localhost",
4      "port": "443",
5      "host-ssl-key":  "/etc/pki/tls/private/libwebsockets.org.key",
6      "host-ssl-cert": "/etc/pki/tls/certs/libwebsockets.org.crt",
7      "host-ssl-ca":   "/etc/pki/tls/certs/libwebsockets.org.cer",
8      "mounts": [\{
9        "mountpoint": "/",
10        "origin": "file:///var/www/libwebsockets.org",
11        "default": "index.html"
12        \}, \{
13         "mountpoint": "/testserver",
14         "origin": "file:///usr/local/share/libwebsockets-test-server",
15         "default": "test.html"
16        \}],
17      # which protocols are enabled for this vhost, and optional
18      # vhost-specific config options for the protocol
19      #
20      "ws-protocols": [\{
21        "warmcat,timezoom": \{
22          "status": "ok"
23        \}
24      \}]
25     \},
26     \{
27     "name": "localhost",
28     "port": "7681",
29      "host-ssl-key":  "/etc/pki/tls/private/libwebsockets.org.key",
30      "host-ssl-cert": "/etc/pki/tls/certs/libwebsockets.org.crt",
31      "host-ssl-ca":   "/etc/pki/tls/certs/libwebsockets.org.cer",
32      "mounts": [\{
33        "mountpoint": "/",
34        "origin": ">https://localhost"
35      \}]
36    \},
37     \{
38     "name": "localhost",
39     "port": "80",
40      "mounts": [\{
41        "mountpoint": "/",
42        "origin": ">https://localhost"
43      \}]
44    \}
45 
46   ]
47 \}
\end{DoxyCode}


That sets up three vhosts all called \char`\"{}localhost\char`\"{} on ports 443 and 7681 with S\+SL, and port 80 without S\+SL but with a forced redirect to \href{https://localhost}{\tt https\+://localhost}

\subsection*{Vhost name and port }

The vhost name field is used to match on incoming S\+NI or Host\+: header, so it must always be the host name used to reach the vhost externally.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Vhosts may have the same name and different ports, these will each create a listening socket on the appropriate port.
\item Vhosts may also have the same port and different name\+: these will be treated as true vhosts on one listening socket and the active vhost decided at S\+SL negotiation time (via S\+NI) or if no S\+SL, then after the Host\+: header from the client has been parsed.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Protocols }

Vhosts by default have available the union of any initial protocols from context creation time, and any protocols exposed by plugins.

Vhosts can select which plugins they want to offer and give them per-\/vhost settings using this syntax 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 "ws-protocols": [\{
2   "warmcat-timezoom": \{
3     "status": "ok"
4   \}
5 \}]
\end{DoxyCode}


The \char`\"{}x\char`\"{}\+:\char`\"{}y\char`\"{} parameters like \char`\"{}status\char`\"{}\+:\char`\"{}ok\char`\"{} are made available to the protocol during its per-\/vhost L\+W\+S\+\_\+\+C\+A\+L\+L\+B\+A\+C\+K\+\_\+\+P\+R\+O\+T\+O\+C\+O\+L\+\_\+\+I\+N\+IT ( is a pointer to a linked list of struct \hyperlink{structlws__protocol__vhost__options}{lws\+\_\+protocol\+\_\+vhost\+\_\+options} containing the name and value pointers).

To indicate that a protocol should be used when no Protocol\+: header is sent by the client, you can use \char`\"{}default\char`\"{}\+: \char`\"{}1\char`\"{} 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 "ws-protocols": [\{
2   "warmcat-timezoom": \{
3     "status": "ok",
4     "default": "1"
5   \}
6 \}]
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Other vhost options }


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item If the three options {\ttfamily host-\/ssl-\/cert}, {\ttfamily host-\/ssl-\/ca} and {\ttfamily host-\/ssl-\/key} are given, then the vhost supports S\+SL.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Each vhost may have its own certs, S\+NI is used during the initial connection negotiation to figure out which certs to use by the server name it\textquotesingle{}s asking for from the request D\+NS name.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily keeplive-\/timeout} (in secs) defaults to 60 for lwsws, it may be set as a vhost option
\item {\ttfamily interface} lets you specify which network interface to listen on, if not given listens on all
\item \char`\"{}`unix-\/socket`\char`\"{}\+: \char`\"{}1\char`\"{} causes the unix socket specified in the interface option to be used instead of an I\+N\+ET socket
\item \char`\"{}`sts`\char`\"{}\+: \char`\"{}1\char`\"{} causes lwsws to send a Strict Transport Security header with responses that informs the client he should never accept to connect to this address using http. This is needed to get the A+ security rating from S\+SL Labs for your server.
\item \char`\"{}`access-\/log`\char`\"{}\+: \char`\"{}filepath\char`\"{} sets where apache-\/compatible access logs will be written
\item {\ttfamily \char`\"{}enable-\/client-\/ssl\char`\"{}}\+: {\ttfamily \char`\"{}1\char`\"{}} enables the vhost\textquotesingle{}s client S\+SL context, you will need this if you plan to create client conections on the vhost that will use S\+SL. You don\textquotesingle{}t need it if you only want http / ws client connections.
\item \char`\"{}`ciphers`\char`\"{}\+: \char`\"{}$<$cipher list$>$\char`\"{} sets the allowed list of ciphers and key exchange protocols for the vhost. The default list is restricted to only those providing P\+FS (Perfect Forward Secrecy) on the author\textquotesingle{}s Fedora system.
\end{DoxyItemize}

If you need to allow weaker ciphers,you can provide an alternative list here per-\/vhost.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \char`\"{}`ecdh-\/curve`\char`\"{}\+: \char`\"{}$<$curve name$>$\char`\"{} The default ecdh curve is \char`\"{}prime256v1\char`\"{}, but you can override it here, per-\/vhost
\item \char`\"{}`noipv6`\char`\"{}\+: \char`\"{}on\char`\"{} Disable ipv6 completely for this vhost
\item \char`\"{}`ipv6only`\char`\"{}\+: \char`\"{}on\char`\"{} Only allow ipv6 on this vhost / \char`\"{}off\char`\"{} only allow ipv4 on this vhost
\item \char`\"{}`ssl-\/option-\/set`\char`\"{}\+: \char`\"{}$<$decimal$>$\char`\"{} Sets the S\+SL option flag value for the vhost. It may be used multiple times and OR\textquotesingle{}s the flags together.
\end{DoxyItemize}

The values are derived from /usr/include/openssl/ssl.h 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 # define SSL\_OP\_NO\_TLSv1\_1                               0x10000000L
\end{DoxyCode}


would equate to


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 "`ssl-option-set`": "268435456"
\end{DoxyCode}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \char`\"{}`ssl-\/option-\/clear\textquotesingle{}\char`\"{}\+: \char`\"{}$<$decimal$>$\char`\"{} Clears the S\+SL option flag value for the vhost. It may be used multiple times and OR\textquotesingle{}s the flags together.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Mounts }

Where mounts are given in the vhost definition, then directory contents may be auto-\/served if it matches the mountpoint.

Mount protocols are used to control what kind of translation happens


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item \href{file://}{\tt file\+://} serve the uri using the remainder of the url past the mountpoint based on the origin directory.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Eg, with this mountpoint 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 \{
2  "mountpoint": "/",
3  "origin": "file:///var/www/mysite.com",
4  "default": "/"
5 \}
\end{DoxyCode}
 The uri /file.jpg would serve /var/www/mysite.com/file.\+jpg, since / matched.


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item $^\wedge$http\+:// or $^\wedge$https\+:// these cause any url matching the mountpoint to issue a redirect to the origin url
\item cgi\+:// this causes any matching url to be given to the named cgi, eg 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 \{
2  "mountpoint": "/git",
3  "origin": "cgi:///var/www/cgi-bin/cgit",
4  "default": "/"
5 \}, \{
6  "mountpoint": "/cgit-data",
7  "origin": "file:///usr/share/cgit",
8  "default": "/"
9 \},
\end{DoxyCode}
 would cause the url /git/myrepo to pass \char`\"{}myrepo\char`\"{} to the cgi /var/www/cgi-\/bin/cgit and send the results to the client.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\subsection*{Other mount options }

1) When using a cgi\+:// protcol origin at a mountpoint, you may also give cgi environment variables specific to the mountpoint like this 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 \{
2  "mountpoint": "/git",
3  "origin": "cgi:///var/www/cgi-bin/cgit",
4  "default": "/",
5  "cgi-env": [\{
6          "CGIT\_CONFIG": "/etc/cgitrc/libwebsockets.org"
7  \}]
8 \}
\end{DoxyCode}
 This allows you to customize one cgi depending on the mountpoint (and / or vhost).

2) It\textquotesingle{}s also possible to set the cgi timeout (in secs) per cgi\+:// mount, like this 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 "cgi-timeout": "30"
\end{DoxyCode}
 3) {\ttfamily callback\+://} protocol may be used when defining a mount to associate a named protocol callback with the U\+RL namespace area. For example 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 \{
2  "mountpoint": "/formtest",
3  "origin": "callback://protocol-post-demo"
4 \}
\end{DoxyCode}
 All handling of client access to /formtest\mbox{[}anything\mbox{]} will be passed to the callback registered to the protocol \char`\"{}protocol-\/post-\/demo\char`\"{}.

This is useful for handling P\+O\+ST http body content or general non-\/cgi http payload generation inside a plugin.

See the related notes in R\+E\+A\+D\+M\+E.\+coding.\+md

4) Cache policy of the files in the mount can also be set. If no options are given, the content is marked uncacheable. 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 \{
2  "mountpoint": "/",
3  "origin": "file:///var/www/mysite.com",
4  "cache-max-age": "60",      # seconds
5  "cache-reuse": "1",         # allow reuse at client at all
6  "cache-revalidate": "1",    # check it with server each time
7  "cache-intermediaries": "1" # allow intermediary caches to hold
8 \}
\end{DoxyCode}


4) You can also define a list of additional mimetypes per-\/mount 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 "extra-mimetypes": \{
2          ".zip": "application/zip",
3          ".doc": "text/evil"
4  \}
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{Plugins }

Protcols and extensions may also be provided from \char`\"{}plugins\char`\"{}, these are lightweight dynamic libraries. They are scanned for at init time, and any protocols and extensions found are added to the list given at context creation time.

Protocols receive init (L\+W\+S\+\_\+\+C\+A\+L\+L\+B\+A\+C\+K\+\_\+\+P\+R\+O\+T\+O\+C\+O\+L\+\_\+\+I\+N\+IT) and destruction (L\+W\+S\+\_\+\+C\+A\+L\+L\+B\+A\+C\+K\+\_\+\+P\+R\+O\+T\+O\+C\+O\+L\+\_\+\+D\+E\+S\+T\+R\+OY) callbacks per-\/vhost, and there are arrangements they can make per-\/vhost allocations and get hold of the correct pointer from the wsi at the callback.

This allows a protocol to choose to strictly segregate data on a per-\/vhost basis, and also allows the plugin to handle its own initialization and context storage.

To help that happen conveniently, there are some new apis


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item lws\+\_\+vhost\+\_\+get(wsi)
\item lws\+\_\+protocol\+\_\+get(wsi)
\item lws\+\_\+callback\+\_\+on\+\_\+writable\+\_\+all\+\_\+protocol\+\_\+vhost(vhost, protocol)
\item lws\+\_\+protocol\+\_\+vh\+\_\+priv\+\_\+zalloc(vhost, protocol, size)
\item lws\+\_\+protocol\+\_\+vh\+\_\+priv\+\_\+get(vhost, protocol)
\end{DoxyItemize}

dumb increment, mirror and status protocol plugins are provided as examples.

\subsection*{Additional plugin search paths }

Packages that have their own lws plugins can install them in their own preferred dir and ask lwsws to scan there by using a config fragment like this, in its own conf.\+d/ file managed by the other package 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 \{
2   "global": \{
3    "plugin-dir": "/usr/local/share/coherent-timeline/plugins"
4   \}
5 \}
\end{DoxyCode}


\subsection*{lws-\/server-\/status plugin }

One provided protocol can be used to monitor the server status.

Enable the protocol like this on a vhost\textquotesingle{}s ws-\/protocols section 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 "lws-server-status": \{
2   "status": "ok",
3   "update-ms": "5000"
4 \}
\end{DoxyCode}
 \char`\"{}update-\/ms\char`\"{} is used to control how often updated J\+S\+ON is sent on a ws link.

And map the provided H\+T\+ML into the vhost in the mounts section 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 \{
2  "mountpoint": "/server-status",
3  "origin": "file:///usr/local/share/libwebsockets-test-server/server-status",
4  "default": "server-status.html"
5 \}
\end{DoxyCode}
 You might choose to put it on its own vhost which has \char`\"{}interface\char`\"{}\+: \char`\"{}lo\char`\"{}, so it\textquotesingle{}s not externally visible.

\subsection*{Integration with Systemd }

lwsws needs a service file like this as {\ttfamily /usr/lib/systemd/system/lwsws.service} 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 [Unit]
2 Description=Libwebsockets Web Server
3 After=syslog.target
4 
5 [Service]
6 ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/lwsws
7 StandardError=null
8 
9 [Install]
10 WantedBy=multi-user.target
\end{DoxyCode}


You can find this prepared in {\ttfamily ./lwsws/usr-\/lib-\/systemd-\/system-\/lwsws.service}

\subsection*{Integration with logrotate }

For correct operation with logrotate, {\ttfamily /etc/logrotate.d/lwsws} (if that\textquotesingle{}s where we\textquotesingle{}re putting the logs) should contain 
\begin{DoxyCode}
1 /var/log/lwsws/*log \{
2     copytruncate
3     missingok
4     notifempty
5     delaycompress
6 \}
\end{DoxyCode}
 You can find this prepared in {\ttfamily /lwsws/etc-\/logrotate.d-\/lwsws}

Prepare the log directory like this


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 sudo mkdir /var/log/lwsws
2 sudo chmod 700 /var/log/lwsws
\end{DoxyCode}
